            <div class="body-text"><b><i>On Earth We&rsquo;re Briefly Gorgeous</i>, by Ocean Vuong</b>: &#8220;Because the sunset, like survival, exists only on the verge of its own disappearing. To be gorgeous, you must first be seen, but to be seen allows you to be hunted.&#8221;</div><br>
            <div class="body-text"><b><i>I&rsquo;ll Give You The Sun</i>, by Jandy Nelson</b>: &#8220;We were all heading for each other on a collision course, no matter what. Maybe some people are just meant to be in the same story.&#8221;</div><br>
            <div class="body-text"><b><i>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</i>, by Doris Kearns Goodwin</b>: &#8220;The deathless name he sought from the start had grown far beyond Sangamon County and Illinois, reached across the truly United States, until his legacy, as Stanton had surmised at the moment of his death, belonged not only to America but to the ages.&#8221;</div><br>
            <div class="body-text"><b><i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, by Ernest Hemingway</b>: &#8220;After a while I went out and left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain.&#8221;</div><br>
            <div class="body-text"><b><i>When Breath Becomes Air</i>, by Paul Kalanithi</b>: &#8220;And with that, the future I had imagined, the one just about to be realized, the culmination of decades of striving, evaporated.&#8221;</div><br>
            <div class="body-text"><b><i>Spacestruck</i>, by Paige Lewis</b>: &#8220;I feel / as if I&rsquo;m on the moon listening to the air hiss / out of my spacesuit, and I can&rsquo;t find the hole. I&rsquo;m / the vice president of panic, and the president is / missing.&#8221;</div><br>
            <div class="body-text"><b><i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, by Haruki Murakami</b>: &#8220;I thought of May Kasahara, with her blue wool hat, along on the bus taking her back to her factory in the hills.

            <div class="body-text"><b><i>Night Sky With Exit Wounds</i>, by Ocean Vuong</b>: &#8220;At home, I threw myself on the bed like a torch & watched the flames / gnaw through my mother&rsquo;s house until the sky appeared, bloodshot & massive. / How I wanted to be that sky—to hold every flight & fall at once.&#8221;</div><br>

          <div class="body-text"><b>Background:</b> I&rsquo;m drawn to media-adjacent startups for the breadth and depth of skills required, from planning editorial direction to managing staffers to very often having to bootstrap the software (websites, etc) behind everything. <br><br>Past publications I&rsquo;ve launched include <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tnjcollective/">the New Journalism Collective</a> (5000+ impressions on Instagram) and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnserJournal"><i>Anser Journal</i></a> (~10K+ monthly Twitter impressions). I also have traditional experience in writing/reporting; most recently, I’ve been a writer for <a href="https://theyappie.com/"><i>The Yappie</i></a>, a publication focused on elevating coverage of AAPI power and politics. Writing awards include publication in Scholastic Inc.&rsquo;s <i>The Best Teen Writing of 2020</i> and an Al Neuharth Free Spirit scholarship from the Freedom Forum.</div><br>
          <div class="body-text"><b>Currently:</b> I&rsquo;m spending time...</div>
          <ul>
            <li class="body-text">Navigating college @ Princeton and taking classes in CS, creative writing, and philosophy.</li>
            <li class="body-text">Brushing up on my rusty CS and attempting to teach myself frontend. I coded most of this website myself, with some help from outside repos :)</li>
            <li class="body-text">Scouting out off-campus opportunities for the future (internships, work experience, etc).</li>
            <li class="body-text">Thinking about (the flaws of) meritocracies, degree inflation, human capital, and paths of least resistance.</li>
            <li class="body-text">Connecting with people working in media, tech, VC, or similar spaces for insightful conversations!</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="body-text"><b>Long-term:</b> I&rsquo;m increasingly concerned about the journalism industry’s struggle to adapt to the modern media ecosystem, especially as social media siphons readers away from newspapers. Silicon Valley and journalism are often at odds with each other, but I think there&rsquo;s a clear intersection between the two spaces — to uphold the mission/ethics of journalism while pulling in readers and being financially sustainable (see: <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.column.us/">Column</a>, etc). In the future, I&rsquo;d love to be working in that intersection via my own startup or as part of an early-stage startup, but I&rsquo;m open to other possibilities that come my way!</div><br>
